Buffer Overflow / Memory Corruption Lab

This is desgined to be a walkthrough to the basics of memory corruption by overflowing buffers on the stack. The first step in this lab is to understand and visualize what a stack looks like, how a machine creates a stack, and how a machine uses the stack for its operations. The exploitable programs are all written in 'C' and are compiled specifically to contain certain stack vulnerabilities. The security measures that are compiled out of the programs are also explored.  

<b>Step 1: Understanding The Stack</b>
This gives a basic overview of what a stack is and how it is set up by a program.

<b>Step 2: Exploiting The Stack</b>
A walkthrough of a simple buffer overflow (1990s era exploit). Stack protections such as stack cookies, ASLR, and DEP are not compiled into the exploitable program in order to make it easier to exploit. 

<b>In Progress...</b>
