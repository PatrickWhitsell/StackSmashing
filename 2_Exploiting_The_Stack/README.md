Exploiting The Stack
==============

First we will take a look at smash_this.c, which is our exploitable program. All this program does is read in from a file, and output that to the screen. However, it does this in a very insecure way. Notice that fread() is capable of reading in 0x1000 bytes of data from the file, and will copy this to buffer. The problem is that buffer is only 16 bytes long! This exercise will demonstrate how vulnrabilities such as this can be exploited to run our own code.  

Now lets use the make file to compile the exercise.  

    make -f makefile.mak

This will compile smash_this.c into smash_this.x and make it's stack executable. These days stacks are set up to be strictly read/write and non-executable to prevent execution of arbitrary code that has been injected by an attacker. The make file also disables Address Space Layout Randomization. ASLR is a obfuscation technique used to make buffer overflows and other exploits more difficult. ASLR randomizes the addresses of as many components in the stack as it can.
